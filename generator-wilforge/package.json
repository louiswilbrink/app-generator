  "description": "This generator will provide User and session management and email administration out of the box -- without installing a database on your local machine!  It's built using Angular, Firebase, Express, Gulp and PassportJS.  When the generator is launched, you will be required to provide a Firebase and Mandrill endpoint.  Using these platform services is what allows you to start building your app without the messiness of adding more coupled infrastructure to your local/staging/production machines",
